# CrapGPT2-Markov
A shitty pre-trained sentence generator based on markovify

First version has around 20 MB of corpus data.

# Limitations

- There is minimal support for text generation in different languages, however those can sometimes mix up or fail to generate more often than English input.
- May generate offensive content or false information
- Sentence generation can fail at times
